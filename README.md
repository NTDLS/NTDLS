- 👋 Hi, I'm @NTDLS (AKA Josh Patterson) and I'm living like Larry 🦞.
- 👀 I'm interested in C / C++ / C# and the Sea (mainly the Atlantic as I live in Charleston SC).
  - 💅 The line above was misleading, I also enjoy everything between assembly and SQL!
  - 😆 The line above was also misleading as both Java and VB can go :no_mouth: themselves.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to create Change Requests for even the most simple tasks.
