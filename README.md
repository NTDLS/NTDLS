- 👋 Hi, I'm @NTDLS (AKA Josh Patterson).
- 👀 I'm interested in C / C++ / C# and the Sea (mainly the Atlantic as I live in Charleston SC).
- :nail_care: The line above was misleading, I also enjoy everything between assembly and SQL.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to create Change Requests and enter tickets for pretty much anything that needs to be done.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/TightWiki
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/NTDLS.Katzebase.Server
  - Literally any other repo I've posted.
- 📫 How to reach me: ✨ Josh@NTDLS.com ✨   <---Yea, I posted that. Sue me.
- My website is: http://networkdls.com/
