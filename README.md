- 👋 Hi, I'm @NTDLS (AKA Josh Patterson) and I'm living like Larry 🦞.
- 👀 I'm interested in C / C++ / C# and the Sea (mainly the Atlantic as I live in Charleston SC).
  - 💅 The line above was misleading, I also enjoy everything between assembly and SQL!
  - 😆 The line above was also misleading as both Java and VB can go :no_mouth: themselves.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to create Change Requests and enter tickets for the most petty of tasks.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/TightWiki
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/Katzebase
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/CatMQ
  - https://github.com/NTDLS/KitKey
  - Literally any other repo I've created.
- 📫 How to reach me: ✨ Josh@NTDLS.com ✨   <---Yea, I posted that. Sue me.
- My website is: https://NetworkDLS.com/ (If it looks like it was built in the 90s... it was).
